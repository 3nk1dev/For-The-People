## Concatenating Strings
```py
first_name = "Julie"
last_name = "Blevins"

def account_generator(first_name, last_name):
  return str(first_name[:3] + last_name[:3])

new_account = account_generator(first_name, last_name)

```

## More string slicing
```py
first_name = "Reiko"
last_name = "Matsuki"

def password_generator(first_name, last_name):
  return first_name[-3:] + last_name[-3:]
temp_password = password_generator(first_name, last_name)
```

## iterating through strings
```py
 def get_length(word):
  counter = 0
  for letter in word:
    counter += 1
  return counter
```

## Strings and Conditionals (Part One)
```py
def letter_check(word, letter):
  if letter in word:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

## Strings and Conditionals (Part Two)
```py
def contains(big_string, little_string):
  if little_string in big_string:
    return True
  else:
    return False

print(contains("watermelon", "melon"))
def common_letters(string_one, string_two):
  common = []
  for letter in string_one:
    if letter in string_two and letter not in common:
      common.append(letter)
  return common

  if len(first_name) < 3 or len(last_name) < 4:
    username = first_name + last_name
  else:
    username = first_name[:3] + last_name[:4]
  return username
def password_generator(user_name):
  password = ""
  for i in range(len(user_name)):
    password += user_name[i-1]


## Review

  if len(first_name) < 3 or len(last_name) < 4:
    username = first_name + last_name
  else:
    username = first_name[:3] + last_name[:4]
  return username
  
def password_generator(user_name):
    password = ""
 
    for i in range(len(user_name)):
      password += user_name[i - 1]
    return password

    print(password_generator("apple"))
  ```

## Formatting Methods

##### There are three string methods that can change the casing of a string. These are .lower(), .upper(), and .title().

## Splitting Strings
###### .split()

```py
line_one = "The sky has given over"

line_one_words = line_one.split()

print(line_one_words)
```

### Splitting Strings 2

```py
authors = "Audre Lorde,Gabriela Mistral,Jean Toomer,An Qi,Walt Whitman,Shel Silverstein,Carmen Boullosa,Kamala Suraiyya,Langston Hughes,Adrienne Rich,Nikki Giovanni"

author_names = authors.split(",")

print(author_names)

author_last_names = author_names[0:]
author_last_names = [name.split()[-1] for name in author_names]
```

### Splitting Strings 3

##### We can also split strings using escape sequences. Escape sequences are used to indicate that we want to split by something in a string that is not necessarily a character. The two escape sequences we will cover here are

\n Newline
\t Horizontal Tab
```py
smooth_chorus = \
"""And if you said, "This life ain't good enough."
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth"""

chorus_lines = smooth_chorus.split('\n')

print(chorus_lines)
```

## Joining Strings
### .join()

#### Remember the ' '
```py
'delimiter'.join(list_you_want_to_join)
```

```py
reapers_line_one_words = ["Black", "reapers", "with", "the", "sound", "of", "steel", "on", "stones"]

reapers_line_one = ' '.join(reapers_line_one_words)
```

## Joining Strings 2
```py
winter_trees_lines = ['All the complicated details', 'of the attiring and', 'the disattiring are completed!', 'A liquid moon', 'moves gently among', 'the long branches.', 'Thus having prepared their buds', 'against a sure winter', 'the wise trees', 'stand sleeping in the cold.']

winter_trees_full = '\n'.join(winter_trees_lines)

print(winter_trees_full)
```
## .strip()
#### Cleaning Data
EX
```py
featuring = "           rob thomas                 "
print(featuring.strip())
# => 'rob thomas'
```
## Replace
```py
string_name.replace(substring_being_replaced, new_substring)

#Great! Let’s put it in context and look at an example.

with_spaces = "You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth"
with_underscores = with_spaces.replace(' ', '_')
print(with_underscores)
# 'You_got_the_kind_of_loving_that_can_be_so_smooth'
```

## .find()

#### Another interesting string method is .find(). .find() takes a string as an argument and searching the string it was run on for that string. It then returns the first index value where that string is located.

```py
print('smooth'.find('t'))
# => '4'
```
## .format()
#### Python also provides a handy string method for including variables in strings. This method is .format(). .format() takes variables as an argument and includes them in the string that it is run on. You include {} marks as placeholders for where those variables will be imported.

```py
def poem_title_card(title, poet):
  poem_desc = "The poem \"{}\" is written by {}.".format(title, poet)
  return poem_desc

print(poem_title_card("I Hear America Singing","Walt Whitman"))
```
## .format() 2
#### keywords
```pydef poem_description(publishing_date, author, title, original_work):
  poem_desc = "The poem {title} by {author} was originally published in {original_work} in {publishing_date}.".format(publishing_date=publishing_date, author=author, title=title, original_work=original_work)
  return poem_desc

my_beard_description = poem_description(title="My Beard", author="Shel Silverstein", original_work="Where the Sidewalk Ends", publishing_date="1974")
```
## String Review 

Over this lesson you’ve learned:

.upper(), .title(), and .lower() adjust the casing of your string.
.split() takes a string and creates a list of substrings.
.join() takes a list of strings and creates a string.
.strip() cleans off whitespace, or other noise from the beginning and end of a string.
.replace() replaces all instances of a character/string in a string with another character/string.
.find() searches a string for a character/string and returns the index value that character/string is found at.
.format() allows you to interpolate a string with variables.

tc_id = user_ids.get("teraCoder", 100000)
stack_id = user_ids.get("superStackSmash", 100000)

print(tc_id)
print(stack_id)
```

## Get a Key
```py
zodiac_elements = {"water": ["Cancer", "Scorpio", "Pisces"], "fire": ["Aries", "Leo", "Sagittarius"], "earth": ["Taurus", "Virgo", "Capricorn"], "air":["Gemini", "Libra", "Aquarius"]}

print(zodiac_elements["earth"])

print(zodiac_elements["fire"])
```


## Get an Invalid Key
```py
zodiac_elements = {"water": ["Cancer", "Scorpio", "Pisces"], "fire": ["Aries", "Leo", "Sagittarius"], "earth": ["Taurus", "Virgo", "Capricorn"], "air":["Gemini", "Libra", "Aquarius"]}

zodiac_elements["energy"] = "Not a Zodiac element"

if "energy" in zodiac_elements: 
  print(zodiac_elements["energy"])
```

## Safely Get A Key
```py
user_ids = {"teraCoder": 100019, "pythonGuy": 182921, "samTheJavaMaam": 123112, "lyleLoop": 102931, "keysmithKeith": 129384}

stack_id = user_ids.get("superStackSmash", 100000)

print(tc_id)
print(stack_id)
```

## Delete A Key

```py
available_items = {"health potion": 10, "cake of the cure": 5, "green elixir": 20, "strength sandwich": 25, "stamina grains": 15, "power stew": 30}
health_points = 20

health_points += available_items.pop("power stew", 0)
health_points += available_items.pop("mystic bread", 0)

print(available_items, health_points)
```

## Get All Keys

```py
user_ids = {"teraCoder": 100019, "pythonGuy": 182921, "samTheJavaMaam": 123112, "lyleLoop": 102931, "keysmithKeith": 129384}
num_exercises = {"functions": 10, "syntax": 13, "control flow": 15, "loops": 22, "lists": 19, "classes": 18, "dictionaries": 18}

users = user_ids.keys()

lessons = num_exercises.keys()

print(users)

print(lessons)
```

## Get All Values

```py
num_exercises = {"functions": 10, "syntax": 13, "control flow": 15, "loops": 22, "lists": 19, "classes": 18, "dictionaries": 18}

total_exercises = 0

for totals in num_exercises.values():
  total_exercises += totals

print(total_exercises)

```

## Get All Items

```py
pct_women_in_occupation = {"CEO": 28, "Engineering Manager": 9, "Pharmacist": 58, "Physician": 40, "Lawyer": 37, "Aerospace Engineer": 9}

for role, value in pct_women_in_occupation.items():
    print("Women make up " + str(value) + " percent of " + role + "s.")
```

## Review
```py 
tarot = { 1:	"The Magician", 2:	"The High Priestess", 3:	"The Empress", 4:	"The Emperor", 5:	"The Hierophant", 6:	"The Lovers", 7:	"The Chariot", 8:	"Strength", 9:	"The Hermit", 10:	"Wheel of Fortune", 11:	"Justice", 12:	"The Hanged Man", 13:	"Death", 14:	"Temperance", 15:	"The Devil", 16:	"The Tower", 17:	"The Star", 18:	"The Moon", 19:	"The Sun", 20:	"Judgement", 21:	"The World", 22: "The Fool"}

spread = {}

spread["past"] = tarot.pop(13)
spread["present"] = tarot.pop(22)
spread["future"] = tarot.pop(10)

for key, value in spread.items():
    print("Your " + key + " is the " + str(value) + " card.")
```

## Reading A File
```py
with open('welcome.txt') as text_file:
  text_data = text_file.read()

print(text_data)
```

## Iterating Through Lines

IMPORTANT: DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN .readlines() and .readline() 

```py
with open('how_many_lines.txt') as lines_doc:
   for line in lines_doc.readlines():
    print(line)
```

## Reading A Line

ONE LINE AT A TIME

```py
with open('just_the_first.txt') as first_line_doc:
  first_line = first_line_doc.readline()
  second_line = first_line_doc.readline()
  print(first_line)
```

## Writing A File

w argument writes a new file
```py
with open('bad_bands.txt', 'w') as bad_bands_doc:
  bad_bands_doc.write("Nickelback!")
```

## Appending to a file
